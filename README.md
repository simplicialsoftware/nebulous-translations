# nebulous-translations

## Purpose
The sole purpose of this repository is to allow Nebulous players to collectively improve the translated text used in Nebulous.io [[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=software.simplicial.nebulous)][[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nebulous-io/id1069691018)]. Include your Nebulous ID in your PR (Pull Request) description or comments and you may be granted the translator tag in the game after your PR is approved and merged. If you receive the tag, open your Discord app or website, access the [neb channel](https://discord.com/channels/941543004026572811/955135555404963860) in Nebulous server, then type a "/neb update" to receive the role next to your name. **Low quality translations (those receiving a high number of comments compared to the number of translations done), will not receive a tag.**

## Instructions
If you have general questions or a suggestion, submit an [issue](https://github.com/simplicialsoftware/nebulous-translations/issues). You can also submit a [suggestion](https://discord.com/channels/941543004026572811/941680724963123200) in Discord server. **Do not use the issue tracker to discuss topics other than the *translation reports*, nor to request for Translator tag. If you have questions that are non-related to translations, please use the [ticket](https://discord.com/channels/941543004026572811/942039671687479336) tab and open one, or use other existing text channels such as bug reports.**

If you have an improvement to make, edit a file and submit a pull request. Pay special attention to the use of placeholders (ex: `\n`, `%s`, `%d`, or similars) and formatting. Changes to the formatting of the file will not be accepted.

### Organization
Open the `res` folder to see all of the supported languages. `res/values` contains the English strings used as the default for any non-translated strings. Translations should be based on that file.

### Tips
- Only edit files for which you are a native speaker or have fluency.
- Try not to change the *length* of a string too much from the length in the English version. The app UI layout is tested with those string lengths.
- **Do not** submit auto translations (Google Translate, Chat GPT, etc). This is not helpful.
- Adding comments to your PR that explains why subtle changes were made can help. If you are revising something that is already translated, an explanation is **required**.
- Only edit files if you see something wrong with the texts in a language. You must check **first** in-game if there's a typo, missing translation, word used on invalid context, or any similar mistake, so you can look for the string line that belongs to that/those specific text(s) to be corrected for your language. A full review of the language file is also advisable.
- Remember you are on GitHub – translation files involve coding. It's greatly recommended that you have comprehension over it to avoid issues with the linter. Always pay attention to all your changes to make sure your PR can be merged safely. Changes to the original string values (attached in blue color and in English with bottom lines `_`), implementations of text next to `string array`'s or changes to specific coding texts such as `</string>` are **not** allowed. Learn more about how to use GitHub [here](https://youtu.be/v_1iqtOnUMg).
- While you are analyzing a language file, avoid using web-translators provided by browsers like Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, Safari etc. It may result in a conflict or confusion between the original value because of the bottom lines `_` and the translation. The GitHub website currently only supports English language.
- **Do not** change the `res/values` (English file) without authorization or consent of the developer. You must ask for permission and tell why you want to make changes into the English file – PR's which concern English file updates cannot be granted with the Translator tag. You can report what's wrong with the English file using the [issues](https://github.com/simplicialsoftware/nebulous-translations/issues) tab and, preferably, provide screenshots of what you want to report.

#### Translation tips
When translating content, especially in a consistent and systematic manner, it's important to adhere to the following general tips:
1. Consistency in Terminology
   - Always use the same terms for specific concepts. If you choose to translate one concept/name some way, use it every time that concept/name appears.
   - Maintain consistency in acronyms and capitalizations. For example, use the translation for "XP" or "CTF" consistently without variation.
2. Voice Consistency
   - Decide early whether the translation will be in a formal or informal voice, and stick to it throughout the entire text. 
3. Avoid Unnecessary Punctuation
   - Do not add a period (.) at the end of strings unless it is required by the original text or grammar rules.
   - Keep in mind that some platforms or coding environments may treat punctuation differently, so avoid adding extra punctuation.
   - Speaking of which, ellipsis are preferred over 3 periods. An example follows: … (ellipsis) vs. ... (3 periods).
4. Consistency in Formatting
   - Keep a uniform format with the original. If "Hour" is used, always use the translation with the first letter in caps; same applies otherwise if it's all caps, for example.
5. Contextual Accuracy
   - Translate based on context to maintain the meaning and tone of the original text. Avoid direct translations that might change the intended message.
   - Ensure that terms like "hoarder" or "mogul" are translated in a way that fits the context—either retaining the original term if it’s widely understood or choosing an appropriate equivalent in the target language. AND BE CONSISTENT WITH IT.
6. Uniform Length and Structure
   - Aim for similar length and structure between the original and translated text, especially if space is limited.
   - Break down complex sentences to mirror the original's readability and clarity.
7. Cultural Adaptation
   - Ensure that cultural references, idioms, or colloquialisms are translated or adapted to be understandable in the target culture. Pay mind to terms like "hat-trick", which tends to have translations depending on the language (remember to always do RESEARCH); or "Doge", which doesn't have a translation.
8. Proofreading and Review
   - After translation, review the text to ensure consistency in terminology, voice, and formatting.
   - Ideally, have another person who is fluent in the language review the translation to catch any inconsistencies or errors you might have missed.

## Frequently Asked Questions
#### I saw an untranslated string in Nebulous. It's not in any of the files here. What do I do?
Submit an [issue](https://github.com/simplicialsoftware/nebulous-translations/issues). Include a screenshot of the text and any relevant actions you performed.

#### Why don't all languages have the same strings?
If a language is missing a line of text, see if it's in values (English). If it is, and it has the `translatable="false"` tag, you can:
1. Add it to another language file in the same order as the English file;
2. Change the tag to `translatable="true"`;
3. Translate it.
